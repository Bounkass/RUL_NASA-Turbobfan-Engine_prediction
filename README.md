## RUL_NASA-Turbobfan-Engine_prediction


Prediction Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of NASA Turbobfan Engine 

In this Notbook, a comparative study of
existing set of machine learning models to predict the
Remaining Useful Lifetime (RUL) of aircraftâ€™s turbo fan engine is done.
The dataset considered here is FD001 which is a part of datasets from turbo fan engine data from the Prognostics Data Repository of NASA
